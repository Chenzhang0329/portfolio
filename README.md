## Work Experience
**Data Scientist Intern @ Linamar Ihub (_May 2023 - September 2023_)**
- Worked with the Linamar Manufacturing Monitoring System (LMMS) team to resolve over 1000 terminology mismatches across 60 global factories, established a reference list for future data collection.
- Designed the adjusted outlier detection system by combining the designed cycle time and z-score interval based on each machine.
- Applied the Linear Discriminant Analysis, independent two sampled T-Test and relevant statistical methods to compare the utilization of Hastech and Linergy two production lines.
- Designed an alert system for updating the designed cycle time of each machine to provide an insight to warn workers to update.


**Data Analyst @ China Index Academy (_January 2022 - June 2022_)**
- Utilized Python and MS SQL to visualize and analyze 200 annual index variables and 80 quarterly index variables from macroeconomic indicator databases, resulted in the identification and removal of over 3000 outliers.
- Collaborated with an external manager to simplify the names of over 100 macroeconomic indices, led to a monthly revenue increase of $30,000.
- Partnered with the data collection team to enhance the data collection Python script, enabled automated scraping and cleaning of indicator data, saved valuable time and resources.
- Produced the First Quarter Real Estate New Opening Report by collecting and analyzing data, provided real estate companies with valuable insights into the latest policies and future trends.


## Projects
### Songs Recommendation System
Developed a comprehensive project involving the creation of a Postgres SQL database for streaming Spotify tracker data. Utilized Python to connect to the database, employing SQL queries to clean and process the data effectively. Constructed and compared Random Forest Regression and ALS models, incorporating both implicit and explicit rates. Identified the optimal model, featuring explicit rates, achieving a minimal Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.3364.

### Stock Forecasting with a Hybrid LSTM model
This project involved scraping financial news headlines for five companies (Google, Apple, Tesla, Amazon, and Microsoft) using R, and collecting stock price data through Python and the Yahoo Finance API. Sentiment analysis models were then applied to the news headlines, resulting in sentiment scores. The scores were standardized using max-min standardization and added to the final database. A comparative analysis of LSTM, Linear Regression, and a Hybrid model combining both was conducted, with the LSTM model achieving the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 3.04.

### Dashboard for Top48 Automakers' Stock Price
This project involved designing and coding an RShiny dashboard to offer investors four key functions: statistical summary, historical stock price analysis, comparison analysis, and stock forecast. The dashboard included a candlestick chart with a movable timeline for analyzing bullish and bearish trends. Additionally, the ARIMA model was applied to provide basic forecasting of future stock prices, utilizing 'auto.arima' to identify the best ARIMA model for each selected automaker. The completed project was pushed to GitHub with a comprehensive readme, providing readers with an introduction on how to use the dashboard.
